            <p id="cloud1"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: white;">The</span> damaging effects of hurricanes have become more apparent as each new storm becomes stronger and grows in intensity.</p>
            <p id="cloud2">In recent years, hurricane seasons have been shown to be starting earlier than usual with tropical storms forming as early as the beginning of May.
                According to the Centers for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), our sea levels have the likelihood of rising at least 1-4 feet during our century.
            </p>
            <p id="cloud3">This danger would increase the effects of storm surge, causing the waves near coastal areas to become dangerous for citizens living there due to harsh and unpredictable waves flooding the coastlines.</p>
            <p id="cloud4">Along with rising sea levels, the temperature of the sea itself will also rise with the increase of our carbon footprint.</p>
            <p id="cloud5">Combined with the phenomenon of La Nina, hurricanes will have the chance of becoming Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes more often than compared to our past (C2ES).</p>
            <p id="cloud6"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: white">As</span> our current climate becomes more unpredictable in terms of weather, conditions and environment, many of our landmarks are at risk of their ecosystems becoming unstable or even collapsing due to many animals and plants having to face new dangers that weren't present before.</p>
            <p id="cloud7">According to World Wildlife, half of our plant and animal species could face extinction due to rising carbon emissions and temperatures.</p>
            <p id="cloud8">Many environments are facing erosion, global warming, and the lack of proper energy and food from plants and animals.</p>
            <p id="cloud9">While we have taken measures such as the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit the increasing temperatures from the effects of our carbon emissions, it may still not be enough to be effective.</p>
            <p id="cloud10"><span style="font-size: 2rem; color: white">Our</span> increased knowledge and development in technology is allowing some car companies, such as Tesla, to make a difference and help improve our carbon emissions through the introduction of electric cars. These electric cars rely on connections through outlets rather than gasoline that many other cars still rely on today.</p>
            <p id="cloud11">This change in fueling helps slow down our carbon emissions by half according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Aside from using gasoline as a primary source of fuel, much of the air pollution that currently resides in our atmosphere can be attributed to the vehicles that we drive in our everyday lives.</p>
            <p id="cloud12">Through either normal transportation or the idling of such vehicles, cars and other modes of transportation are the greatest contributors to our carbon footprint (Department of Ecology).</p>
