                <p>According to the BBC, at least 4.1 billion people use the internet daily which contributes 3.7% of our total carbon footprint for our Earth (1.6 billion tons).</p>
                <p>Many data center companies use fossil fuels in order to keep their own building running due to the increasing amount of internet users and data that needs to be stored daily (BBC).</p>
                <p>For Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) each digital transaction has an average carbon footprint between 33.4kg and 48kg (Earth.org).</p>

                <p>Taking in account all factors, anywhere from 10-30% of a household's carbon footprint comes from the food we eat. This percentage is affected by the food's transportation, agricultural practices, and natural emissions from livestock.</p>
                <p>Meats make up approximately 57% of greenhouse gas emissions by food type. Out of every kind of meat, meats like poultry and fish contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p>Fruits, grains, and vegetables contribute to 6.3% of our food emissions combined. Purchasing organic and locally grown will largely reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from these food groups.</p>

                <p>Large appliances like refrigerators emit an annual average of 672lbs of carbon dioxide. Many appliances are developed and integrated with digital displays and functions which results in increased energy consumption.</p>
                <p>Energy becomes more of a necessity as our technology advances with each new innovation that is discovered. Our power plants currently release an average of 0.889lbs of carbon dioxide per kWh in order to help provide for our necessities.</p>
                <p>Renewable energy production releases no carbon dioxide and less CO2 during production when compared to power plants. Alternative sources such as solar, wind, and water cost less in terms of energy consumption and can be considered unlimited in terms of the quantity available on Earth.</p>

                <p>Based on a research study provided by the United Nations Environment Program, it takes approximately 33.4kg of carbon to produce a pair of jeans from production to retail (WorldBank.org).</p>
                <p>"Fast fashion", contributes nearly 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide toward our planet each year due to the excessive amount of material discarded (TheGroupAgainstSmogandPollution.org).</p>
                <p>Due to the demands of the fashion industry, companies contribute 20% of the waste water that is currently in our oceans. It is also fueled by the decision of placing future factories into countries that lack proper environmental laws (Princeton.edu). </p>

                <p>Gasoline is the primary source of fuel for most cars made around the world. According to the University of Michigan, gasoline releases approximately 19.6lbs of CO2 per gallon.</p>
                <p>At a price of $3.26/gal, the average American spends anywhere from $1.4k to $3k on gasoline per year. This is expected to increase as the use of fossil fuels becomes more scarce in the near future.</p>
                <p>Each mile driven averages around 0.74 pounds of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, air pollution builds up consistently and turns the air around us into a health risk that negatively affects our lives.</p>
